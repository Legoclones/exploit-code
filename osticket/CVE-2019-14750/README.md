# CVE-2019-14750
This CVE can only be exploited when initially setting up the osTicket instance. The stored XSS occurs when the admin user is first created with a malicious payload (like `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`) in their firstname or lastname fields. Since this requires a brand-new osTicket instance with no setup, and the resulting user will be the admin anyways, there's no point in exploiting this CVE so I won't provide a relevant PoC.
